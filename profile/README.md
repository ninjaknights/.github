# NinjaKnights

NinjaKnights is a development organization building modular arcade infrastructure for PocketMine-MP.

Our focus is creating reusable systems that allow developers to build structured, scalable mini-games without being tied to a single server implementation.

## Current Project

### nk-arcade-engine

A PocketMine Virion that provides:

- Game registration

The engine is designed to be portable, extensible, and usable by third-party developers.

## Planned Projects

- Cosmetic ownership system
- Developer documentation and tooling
- Reference mini-game implementations

## Future Direction

- Public platform API
- Revenue attribution system for game creators

NinjaKnights is focused on building infrastructure first, then expanding into a full arcade platform.
